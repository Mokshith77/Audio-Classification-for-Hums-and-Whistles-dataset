Basic solution : Using the MLEnd Hums and Whistles dataset, I builT a machine learning pipeline that takes as an input a Potter or a StarWars audio segment and predicts its song label (either Harry or StarWars).

Advance solution : Using Support Vector Machines we got an accuracy of 63. The Aim here is to improve accuracy using different Machine learning models and also a deep learning model(Mel-Frequency cepstral coefficients). And try to find the best parameters for the models.

Potter.zip file is the dataset file for this project.
